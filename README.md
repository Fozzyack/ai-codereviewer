# AI Code Reviewer

AI Code Reviewer is a GitHub Action that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API to provide intelligent feedback and suggestions on
your pull requests. This powerful tool helps improve code quality and saves developers time by automating the code
review process.

## Features

- Reviews pull requests using OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
- Provides intelligent comments and suggestions for improving your code.
- Posts an overall pull request review summary in addition to line-by-line comments.
- Adds a deterministic "Fix Prompt" section in the review summary to help drive AI agent remediation.
- Filters out files that match specified exclude patterns.
- Easy to set up and integrate into your GitHub workflow.

## Setup

1. To use this GitHub Action, you need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, sign up for an API key
   at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup).

2. Add the OpenAI API key as a GitHub Secret in your repository with the name `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can find more
   information about GitHub Secrets [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

3. Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file in your repository and add the following content:

```yaml
name: AI Code Reviewer

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
permissions: write-all
jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: AI Code Reviewer
        uses: your-username/ai-code-reviewer@main
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # The GITHUB_TOKEN is there by default so you just need to keep it like it is and not necessarily need to add it as secret as it will throw an error. [More Details](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret)
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          OPENAI_API_MODEL: "gpt-4" # Optional: defaults to "gpt-4"
          exclude: "**/*.json, **/*.md" # Optional: exclude patterns separated by commas
          include_fix_prompt: "true" # Optional: include agent-ready fix prompt in summary (default: true)
          summary_once: "true" # Optional: post summary/fix prompt only once per PR (default: true)
          fix_prompt_max_items: "20" # Optional: max unique issues included in fix prompt (1-200, default: 20)
```

4. Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username or organization name where the AI Code Reviewer repository is
   located.

5. Customize the `exclude` input if you want to ignore certain file patterns from being reviewed.

6. Commit the changes to your repository, and AI Code Reviewer will start working on your future pull requests.

## How It Works

The AI Code Reviewer GitHub Action retrieves the pull request diff, filters out excluded files, and sends code chunks to
the OpenAI API. It generates both an overall pull request summary and inline review comments, then posts them back as a
GitHub review.

It can also include a deterministic "Fix Prompt" section in the summary, built from detected issues with file and line
references, so you can copy it directly into an AI coding agent. By default, the summary/fix prompt is posted only once
per pull request, while inline comments continue on later updates.

Action.
